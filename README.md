# Christmas tree led control

This project was created for controlling the lights of a christmas tree.

You'll need an arduino, an addressable LED strip and a computer.

There's a directory with arduino sketches and one with python programs,
see their README.md files for more details

## Future ideas:

- Add a bluetooth module for wireless control
- Use a phone (accelerometer) for controlling the lights 
- Use a controller
